# TechiePlanetInterview by Oluwagbemi David Ayodeji

Dear Hiring Manager,
Once again thank you for your consideration. Please note that I intentionally skipped the last question (app development) for the following reasons:
-Respectfully, I am not jobless. This implies that there was a limit to how much I could do considering the fact that I had other things to attend to like actual work. 

-Secondly, It wasn't detailed enough. I wasn't sure how you planned to run/deploy the final WAR file or whether the deployment was part of the task.

-Lastly, I fail to see how a small basic CRUD webapp would demonstrate one's experience with Docker or use of microservices (which is mostly used for relatively large applications). 

I really hope this wouldn't be an issue as I do not take the opportunity for granted; nevertheless, if this is a problem, thank you once again for considering me. 

Have a wonderful week.

Sincerely,

David
